XR SHOWDOWN

*UNITY VERSIONS

XR - Work on at XR
Home - Work on at home

*NOTE

Home_XX
Should always be the latest version to use back at XR
So basically this means, the lastest Home_XX version should be used after any XR_XX version

*UPDATES

2/13/2020 2:31 AM - James Ancira Jr:
Task: Worked on customer interactor.
We now have our own custom interactor that can now interact with objects.
This means we are no longer required to use the interactor from the VRTK scene.

Next Task: Tower Climbing
